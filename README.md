What are LLMs and RAG?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced natural language processing models trained on massive amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the language generation capabilities of LLMs with retrieval from external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and informative responses.

Applications
This section will showcase various applications and tools that leverage LLMs and RAG capabilities, categorized by the model provider or framework used.
